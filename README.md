# kfs
42 kernel from scratch

# Roadmap

## kfs-1

- [ ] Install GRUB on an virtual image
- [ ] Write an ASM boot code that handles multiboot header, and use GRUB to init and
call main function of the kernel itself.
- [ ] Write basic kernel code of the choosen language.
- [ ] Compile it with correct flags, and link it to make it bootable.
- [ ] Once all of those steps above are done, you can write some helpers like kernel types
or basic functions (strlen, strcmp, ...)
- [ ] Your work must not exceed 10 MB.
- [ ] Code the interface between your kernel and the screen.
- [ ] Display "42" on the screen.
